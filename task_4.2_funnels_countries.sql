-- TASK 4.2 â€“ Funnel Breakdown with Country-Based Drop-Off Analysis
-- Tracks user progression through funnel steps (from view_item to purchase) across top 3 countries.
-- Calculates distinct user counts at each step and computes country-level and overall drop-off percentages.
-- Ranks funnel steps based on user volume in the United States for consistent event ordering.
-- Useful for identifying critical drop-off points and comparing country-specific behaviors.
