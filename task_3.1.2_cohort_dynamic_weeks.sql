-- TASK 3.1.2 â€“ Weekly Cohort Retention (Dynamic Week Calculation)
-- Dynamically calculates weekly retention using DATE_DIFF between subscription start and end weeks.
-- Tracks retained users from week 0 through week 6 without hardcoding week numbers.
-- Ideal for extended analysis (e.g., 12 or more weeks) and scalable retention pipelines.
-- Includes logic to exclude incomplete trailing cohorts from future weeks.
