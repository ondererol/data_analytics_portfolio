-- TASK 3.2 Weekly Cohort Retention Rates (Normalized)
-- Calculates weekly retention rates for each cohort based on retained user counts.
-- Uses static week mapping (0â€“6) and sets week_0 = 1.0 (100%) as baseline.
-- Divides each week's retained count by the week_0 cohort size.
-- Useful for heatmaps and trendline visualization in Tableau or Sheets.
